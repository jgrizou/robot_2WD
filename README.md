2 wheel drive robot 
====

A bunch of code and documents I used to design a 2 wheeled drive robot.

You might particulary be interrested by the Arduino code, it includes encoders counter, PID, and communication tools.

The BOM and protocol will be added at some point. Ask me directly for now if you need them.

Have fun!
